<h1>About</h1>

<p>This is a neural network trained on a subset of the 
<a href="https://database.lichess.org/" target="_blank">lichess game database</a>.
The network architecture is similar to that of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.01855" target="_blank">maia</a>: 
a convolutional neural network with additional squeeze and excitation layers.
</p>
<p>
At present, the system does not play at the level of the games it was trained on. 
This is not a limitation of neural networks, per se. 
Neural network based chess engines are known to be able to reach superhuman levels. 
However they heavily depend on search to iterate over a large number of positions selecting the best one. 
This works great when you aim to find the objectively best move. 
</p>

<p>
However, the aim here is human-like play so it is less obvious how to implement search.
We would have to additionally estimate how far ahead the player is likely to plan and what moves they will spot/miss. 
Making the network play as good as expert humans would require solving this problem.
</p>

<p>
Overall, the network isn't terrible. It plays very well in the opening(persumably in large part due to memorization) but 
occasionally fails to see even one move ahead.
